I'm currently working at [Goodfire](https://goodfire.ai) on [Parameter Decomposition](https://www.goodfire.ai/research/stochastic-param-decomp#). You can follow along in our [public slack channel](https://opensourcemechanistic.slack.com/archives/C08N7E5KNG7) and [public research github repo](https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd).

### Posts
- [The geometry of LayerNorm and RMSNorm](./normgeometry.html) - A geometric perspective on LayerNorm and RMSNorm, exploring how they project vectors onto hyperspheres.

 ### Research / ML
- **[Stochastic Parameter Decomposition](https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd) - Directly interpreting the weights of Neural Networks**
- <span style="opacity: 0.5; text-decoration: line-through;">[crosscode](https://github.com/oclivegriffin/crosscode) - A library for training Sparse Crosscoders, Transcoders, and SAEs.</span> I now think [parameter-space interpretability is more promising](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gYfpPbww3wQRaxAFD/activation-space-interpretability-may-be-doomed) than activation-space.
- [Detecting Successful Adversarial Prompting From SAE Activations](https://www.apartresearch.com/project/classification-on-latent-feature-activation-for-detecting-adversarial-prompt-vulnerabilities) - Won 2nd place in [Apart Research](https://www.apartresearch.com/) and [Goodfire's](https://goodfire.ai/) "Reprogramming AI Models" research sprint.
- [My Application to Neel Nanda's MATS stream](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxH7eVnaIqCe8lV0tVrQvMqHesUPTQStsSooiArkPXg) - Investigating use of for-loop variables in toy language models. (i.e. `for (int i = 0; ` should predict `i` as the next token)
- My [solutions](https://github.com/oclivegriffin/ARENA_3.0) for [ARENA 3.0](https://www.arena.education/)
<!-- - [From scratch GPT implementation](https://github.com/oclivegriffin/transformer-from-scratch) -->

### Code
- [Rusp](https://github.com/oclivegriffin/rusp) - A lisp interpreter and Bytecode Compiler/VM written in Rust (name suggestions welcome)
- [Rax](https://github.com/oclivegriffin/rax) - A small deep learning library able to train neural networks in less than 1000 lines of dependency free Rust.
